# A Work Day Scheduler

This app was created as a simple calendar application to allow the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Although this technology is no longer being activiely supported I used the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time, there are opportunities to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality since Moment.js is considered a "legacy" project. However, to effectively learn more about how to support technology as it grows older.


## App Purpose
